My name is Colm Ó hÉigeartaigh. I'm a Senior Principal Product Security Engineer at [Qlik](https://www.qlik.com). I'm an active committer on a ton of ASF projects in the area of security, such as:

 - [Apache Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel)
 - [Apache WSS4J](https://github.com/apache/ws-wss4j)
 - [Apache Directory](https://github.com/apache/directory-server)

Recently I've been contributing also to [OWASP DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo), [OpenSSF Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar) and [Anchore Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft).

In what seems like another lifetime, I also acquired a PhD in the area of cryptography.
